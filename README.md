# NPS-Net-Promoter-Score-

Net Promoter Score (NPS) is a metric used to measure customer loyalty and satisfaction with a company, product, or service. It's commonly used by businesses to gauge the likelihood of customers to recommend their products or services to others. NPS is based on the following question:

"On a scale of 0 to 10, how likely are you to recommend [company/product/service] to a friend or colleague?"

Based on their responses, customers are categorized into three groups:

1) - Promoters (score 9-10): These are highly satisfied and loyal customers who are likely to recommend the product or service to others. They are seen as brand advocates.

2) - Passives (score 7-8): These customers are satisfied but not necessarily enthusiastic or loyal. They may recommend the product or service if asked but are less likely to do so actively.

3) - Detractors (score 0-6): These are unsatisfied customers who may have had negative experiences with the company, product, or service. They are unlikely to recommend it and may even spread negative word-of-mouth.

The Net Promoter Score is calculated by subtracting the percentage of detractors from the percentage of promoters. The score can range from -100 to +100. A positive score indicates that there are more promoters than detractors, while a negative score suggests the opposite. A higher NPS generally indicates higher customer satisfaction and loyalty.
